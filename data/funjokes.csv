145,"For all of you with teenagers or who have had  teenagers or are a teenager you may want to know why they really have a lot in common with cats:  - Neither teenagers nor cats turn their heads when you call them by name.  - No matter what you do for them it is not enough. Indeed all humane efforts are barely adequate to compensate for the privilege of waiting on them hand and foot.  - You rarely see a cat walking outside of the house with an adult human being and it can be safely said that no teenager in his or her right mind wants to be seen in public with his or her parents.  - Even if you tell jokes as well as Jay Leno neither your cat nor your teen will ever crack a smile.  - No cat or teenager shares you taste in music.  - Cats and teenagers can lie on the living-room sofa for hours on end without moving barely breathing.  - Cats have nine lives. Teenagers carry o n as if they did. - Cats and teenagers yawn in exactly the same manner communicating that ultimate human ecstasy -- a sense of complete and utter boredom.  - Cats and teenagers do not improve anyone's furniture.  - Cats that are free to roam outside sometimes have been known to return in the middle of the night to deposit a dead animal in your bedroom. Teenagers are not above that sort of behavior.  Thus if you must raise teenagers the best sources of advice are not other parents but veterinarians. It is also a good idea to keep a guidebook on cats at hand at all times. And remember above all else put out the food and do not make any sudden moves in their direction. When they make up their minds they will finally come to you for some affection and comfort and it will be a triumphant moment for all concerned."

""What's wrong little oil company?"" said a gruff voice nearby. She looked around and there was a funny little creature with spectacles a bald patch and shaving cuts. ""I can't find a dividend"" she said and started crying again. ""Don't worry"" said the creature. ""I can find you one."" ""How?"" said the oil company ""And who are you?"" ""I'm an accountant"" he said. ""As for how I do it never you mind about that. But there's one condition. If I do find it for you you must agree to let me stay with you."" ""Yes yes!"" she said anxious only to get the dividend. The accountant disap peared into some books nearby and stayed there for a while. She could hear him muttering and tut-tutting and transferring accounts. Then he emerged and put his long sloping hand into hers. ""I've found you a dividend"" he said. Her usual cheerfulness returned in an instant and she rushed off to tell her father the Chairman. She forgot all about the accountant until he followed her in and reminded her of her promise; despite all her tears her father insisted that she keep her word and that night the little accountant slept on the floor beside her bed. The next morning she opened her eyes and to her amazement she saw the accountant was exactly the same as he had been before. ""I know what you're thinking"" smiled the accountant. ""You're quite right. Before I was changed into an accountant I was a handsome young man with a devil-may-care attitude and considerable joie de vivre.""

911,"There once was an accountant who lived her whole life without ever taking advantage of any of the people she worked for. In fact she made sure that every job she did resulted in a win-win situation. One day while walking down the street she was tragically hit by a bus and she died. Her soul arrived up in heaven where she was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself. ""Welcome to Heaven"" said St. Peter. ""Before you get settled in though it seems we have a problem. You see strangely enough we've never once had an accountant make it this far and we're not really sure what  to do with you."" ""No problem just let me in."" said the accountant. ""Well I'd like to but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in .""  ""Actually I think I've made up my mind...I prefer to stay in Heaven""  ""Sorry we have rules..."" And with that St. Peter put the accountant in an elevator and it went  down-down-down to hell. The doors opened and the accountant found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all her  friends - fellow accountants that she had worked with and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old  times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. The accountant was having such a good time that before she knew it it was ti me to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved goodbye as she got on the elevator. The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found St. Peter waiting for her. ""Now it's time to spend a day in heaven."" So the accountant spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her. ""So you've spent a day in hell and you've spent a day in heaven. Now you must choose your eternity.""  The accountant paused for a second and then replied ""Well I never thought I'd say this I mean Heaven has been really great and all but I think I had a better time in Hell."" So St. Peter escorted her to the elevator and again the accountant went  down-down-down back to Hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in  garbage and filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks.  The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her. ""I don't understand"" stammered the accountant ""Yesterday I was here and there was a  golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had  a great time. Now all there is is a wasteland of garbage and all my  friends look miserable.""  The Devil looked at her and smiled. ""That's because yesterday you were a recruit but today you're staff.""  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- An accountant applies for the position of Chief Financial Officer.

My answer wasn't right"" ""We know but of all the candidates you came the closest."""

The farmer thinks for a moment it is a big mob and he can't see how anyone could guess correctly so he says ""OK. You're on."" ""Nine hundred and thirty two"" says the man. The farmer takes off his hat and scratches his head. ""I don't know how you did it but that's exactly right. A bet's a bet. Take any  sheep."" The man picks up an animal and is about to walk off when the farmer  says ""Hang on. Bet you double or nothing that I can guess your  occupation.""

""That one costs $1000 because it can do everything the first one can do plus it knows how to prepare financial forecasts"". The startled accountant asks about the third parrot to be told it costs $4000. Needless to say this begs the question ""What can it do?""

Time after time the auditor stopped the bloke made him remove the tarpaulin and then inspected the load. On every occasion there was only scrap metal in the truck which the driver said he was taking to the tip. On three occasions the auditor made the bloke remove the  tarpaulin and then unload the scrap in front of him suspecting that there  might be stolen stock hidden underneath. Nothing. He could never find anything amiss. After a few months of this the auditor was offered a better job elsewhere and resigned. A few weeks later he was drinking in a pub when the shifty character walked in. On a n impulse the auditor went up to him and said ""Look I've left the company I'm not interested in taking it any further and I won't shop you but I just have to know. What were you taking?""

985,"No flight ever leaves on time unless you are running late and need the delay to make the flight. If you are running late for a flight it will depart from the farthest gate within the terminal. If you arrive very early for a flight it inevitably will be delayed. Flights never leave from Gate #1 at any terminal in the world. If you must work on your flight you will experience turbulence as soon as you touch pen to paper. Or start to drink your coffee. If you are assigned a middle seat you can determine who has the seats on the aisle and the window while you are still in the boarding area. Just look for the two largest passengers. Only passengers seated in window seats ever have to get up to go to the lavatory. The crying baby on board is always seated next to you. The best-looking woman/man on your flight is never seated next to you. The less carry-on luggag e space available on an aircraft the more carry-on luggage passengers will bring aboard."

Both appear to be blind; the pilot is using a white cane bumping into passengers right and left as he stumbles down the aisle. The copilot is using a guide dog. Both have their eyes covered with sunglasses. At first the passengers do not react thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke. After a few minutes though the engines start revving and the airplane begins moving down the runway. The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness. They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance. Yet the plane starts accelerating rapidly and people begin panicking. So me passengers are praying and as the plane gets closer and closer to  the end of the runway the voices are becoming more and more  hysterical. When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once. At the very last moment the plane lifts off and is airborne. Up in the cockpit the copilot breathes a sigh of relief and tells the pilot: ""You know one of these days the passengers aren't going to scream and we aren't going to know when to take off!"""

""Do you realize that is the President of the United States airplane?"" ""Yep."" ""Were there any survivors?"" the agent gasped. ""Nope. They's all kilt straight o ut.""

Being someone who took Christmas very seriously and being slightly tired he was not in a particularly good mood. (Almost a scrooge) Going to check in his luggage (which for some reason had become one suitcase with entirely new clothes) he saw hanging mistletoe. Not real mistletoe but very cheap plastic with red paint on some of the rounder parts and green paint on some of the flatter and pointer parts that could be taken for mistletoe only in a very Picasso sort of way.  With a considerable degree of irritation and nowhere else to vent it he said to the attendant ""Even if we were married I would not want to kiss you under such a ghastly mo ckery of mistletoe.""

""Ok I give up. Why is it there?""  ""It's there so you can kiss your luggage good-bye."""

1484,"A young college student had stayed up all night studying for his zoology test the next day. As he entered the classroom he saw ten stands with ten birds on them with a sack over each bird and only the legs showing. He sat right on the front  row because he wanted to do the best job possible. The professor  announced that the test would be to look at each set of bird legs and give the common name habitat genus species etc. The student looked at each set of bird legs. They all looked the same to him. He began to get upset. He had stayed up all night studying and now had to identify birds by their legs. The more he thought about it  the madder he got. Finally he could stand it no longer. He went up to  the professor's desk and said ""What a stupid test! How could anyone tell the difference between birds by looking at their legs?"" With that the student threw his test on the professor's desk an d walked out the door. The professor was surprised. The class was so big that he didn't know every student's name so as the student reached the door the professor called ""Mister what's your name?"" The enraged student pulled up his pant legs and said ""You guess buddy! You guess!"""

""Everyone thought I was the crew boss."""
1488,"A pair of biologists are studying terns on a  rock island just off the coast. While walking on a distant part of the island they are shot at by a group of thugs operating a pot farm. This happens several times and the local law enforcement refuses to investigate. On their last day on the island they happen into a huge pile of harvested grass that has been set out to dry. Quickly they decide to set it on fire to pay the thugs back for shooting at them. The fire takes off and sends plumes of smoke into the sky. As they are running for their boat they notice that the soaring birds are acting weird spiraling out of control and crashing into the trees. The next day they read the headlines in the local paper: Pot Farm Burns - No Tern Left Unstoned."
1489,"A wildlife biologist crew leader has several crews each consisting of two biologists. The crews camped and worked in the woods and he made his rounds to visit each pair every few days. One particular crew Sarah and Jim were not getting  nearly as much work accomplished as the others so he suspected that they  might be up to some funny business. The following day he paid them a visit. ""Is anything funny going on here""? he asked. ""What do you mean by that?"" the pair asked back. ""I mean you're not getting much fieldwork done. Are you two you know maybe doing something you're not supposed to do?"" ""Absolutely not!"" the Jim replied. "" We are strictly co-workers"" ""Oh yes"" the Sarah replied "" We hike all day record our data return back and fall asleep exhausted. ""That's right!"" Jim replied ""and me in my tent and she in hers!"" The crew supervisor spent the remainder of the day in th e field with the pair. He left the field early returned to camp retrieved his Jeep and left the area. The following day the biologist pair had lost their $1000 GPS unit. They searched high and low but could not find it. It had simply disappeared from their camp. After a few frantic days they suspected that the crew leader had taken it. It was the only plausible explanation. That evening they called him on the 2-way radio and politely asked weather he may have inadvertently taken the unit. ""As a matter of fact I did take it the day I came up to see if you two were sleeping together. After realizing I had accidentally taken it with me from the field I placed it in Sarah's sleeping bag where she would be sure to find it!"""
1490,"Dan had been studying whales for over 20  years and had made some thrilling breakthroughs regarding their  communication. He had managed to decode many of their underwater sounds and to translate them into English. His latest research had proved that they can communicate over a distance of 300 miles. When asked what could they possibly have to say at such distances he replied  ""As best as we can figure it is something like - Hey can you hear me now?"
1491,"Ben was assigned a new wildlife technician and she was driving him crazy. She was blonde and pretty and insisted on carrying beauty products in a little field bag - nail polish hair care products gels creams and so on.  One day they were driving the rugged four-wheel drive down a dirt road when a big rabbit ran in front of them and was hit by the truck. Ben pulls over and walks back to the dead rabbit. He felt terrible but there  was clearly nothing he could do for the dead creature.  His blonde partner pipes in and yells ""Waite I have just the  thing!"" She races back to the truck and begins to rifle through her beauty  products. Ben watches as brushes and combs fly from the bag. Finally she races back with an aerosol can and sprays the dead rabbit with it's contents. Immediately the rabbit springs to its feet waves goodbye hops a few feet pauses and waves again. The rabbit repe ats this strange behavior...wave-hop-wave-hop until it disappears over the hill. Ben is amazed and asks ""What in the world is in that can?"" The blonde biologists says "" Duh...look at the label"" You guessed it....  ""Hair Spray .... Immediately revives dead hair and creates a permanent wave"""

Their tape measure is not long enough so one botanist stands on the shoulders of the other and attempts to extend the tape to the tree top but it is not long enough. While trying he falls to the ground. They attempt this about five times and each time the top botanist falls. The logger is laughing but feels sorry for the pair gets out of his truck takes out an electric saw and cuts down the tree. The botanists are looking at him like he is crazy. He then takes a tape measure and measures the tree. ""OK guys the tree is 14' 6."" He then gets in his truck and drives away. The two botanists are stunned and speechless. Finally one says to the other ""How do you like that we are trying to measure the height of the tree and that stupid jerk measures the width."""

1495,"A University had advertised for two biologists to help in their mammalogy department specifically with a group of captive grizzly bears. They had only two applicants - a beautiful young women biologist and an older male biologist. The mammalogist in charge of the project knew that not everyone can handle working with such fierce creatures so he decided to test their  skills with the bears. The two hopefuls followed him out to the bear pen.  He first asked the young women to show him what she could do.  She entered the cage stripped down to her bikini and the largest bear walked up and nuzzled her bare legs.  The astonished mammalogist then said to the old man ""Can you do that?""  ""You're darn right I can"" said the old man ""just get that bear out of there first !"""
1496,"A wildlife biologist is working in the woods miles from the nearest town. He's camped alone with his dog and cat as his companions. Suddenly an old gentleman carrying a small limp dog franticly runs into his camp. ""Please please help me! I think something has happened to Willie. Our Winnebago is parked just around the bend and we've seen you camped here. We didn't know what to do. We thought of you because we had seen all this scientific equipment laying around here. Can you help him?"" "" Sir I'm not a vet I'm a wildlife biologist"" the young biologist told the worried man. ""Can you please just have a look at him I'll pay you anything you need. I just need to know. If he's still alive maybe I can rush him into town."" ""Ok put him here on the table."" The young biologist looks the limp dog over but its plain that the dog is dead no pulse or signs of breathing. ""I'm sorry  sir but I'm afraid poor Willie is dead."" ""No I can't believe that..... It can't be true...are you sure?"" ""Yes I'm quite sure."" ""I just can't believe that....With all this equipment isn't there something you can do? I must be absolutely sure."" The biologist called his big yellow cat over to the table. The cat walked around the dead dog occasionally sniffing at the carcass. He then looks up at the biologist and let out a few weak meows. ""Well the cat say he's dead. Does that assure you?"" ""No I need more than that...Do you have anything else?"" The biologist calls over his big black dog. The dog circles the body a few times sniffing it every now and then. After a few moments the dog barks at the biologist. ""Well now the dog says he's dead. That's all I can do for you  sir."" ""OK well I guess its true. I'll take him back and bury him...How  much do I owe you?"" ""It'll be $650 bucks."" The biologist tells  the old man. ""What??"" replied the old man ""How can you charge that much??!!"" ""Well sir I could have told you he was dead for only a dollar but you're the one that insisted on the cat scan and the lab tests!"""
1497,"A young biologist was sitting on a stump at the edge of their camp. On his face was the saddest hangdog expression. One of the other biologists saw his sad looks and asked ""What's the matter?"" The young biologist said ""They put me in the same tent with old Doctor Perkins. He snores all night takes a bath once a month and talks non-stop about back when he studied passenger pigeons. He's so damn old I think he was a lackey for Charles Darwin. He generally just makes my life Hell. We had a big fight about it and they split us up for a month"" The older biologist said ""That should make you happy.""  The young biologist sadly shook his head and said ""Not when the month is up today!"""
1498,"There were these two Engineers who decided  they would go moose hunting in the backwoods of British Columbia. As it happened they lucked out and got a moose. Unfortunately they were about a mile from their truck. They were having a tough time dragging the animal by the hind legs when a Wildlife Biologist happened upon them. He said ""You know the hair follicles on a moose have a grain to them that causes the hair to lie toward the back. The way you are dragging that moose it increases your coefficient of friction by a huge margin. If you grab it by the antlers and pull you will find the work required to be quite minimal.""  The Engineers thanked him and started dragging the moose by the  antlers. After about an hour one Engineer said ""I can't believe how easy it is to move this moose this way. I sure am glad we ran across that Biologist."" ""Yeah."" said the other. ""But we' re getting further and further away from our truck."""
1499,"A biologist from the North Pole was showing a new recruit the ropes of a polar bear radio tracking program. The new recruit said ""I know how the transmitters work but I have one  question--how do you catch the polar bears in the first place?"" ""I bet you use high-powered tranquilizer dart guns right?"" ""Oh no!"" the experienced biologist replied ""we use an ancient Eskimo technique developed centuries ago. First we dig a huge hole in the  ice. Next we place a circle of green peas all the way around the hole.  Then we go hide behind some ice blocks and wait. Finally when a polar bear comes up to take a pea we kick him in the ice-hole !!!"""
1500,"A group of goose biologists were meeting to brainstorm about the migration tactics of Canada geese. They were particularly interested in applying for a $100000 Federal grant to investigate the ""V"" formation of goose flight. It had been observed that one side of the ""V"" is always longer than the other side. This group would put together a research proposal to apply for the $100000 grant and hopefully find out why this happens. To start off the discussion Todd the Consulting Firm Biologist stands  up and says in typical consultant fashion ""I say we ask for $200000  and attempt to model the wind drag coefficients. We can have our  geologists record and map the ground topography and then our staff  meteorologists can predict potential updraft currents. Our internal CAD department can then produce 3-d drawings of the predicted wing tip vortices. Then after several years of study our in-house  publications department could produce a nice thick report full of charts and graphs."" The Senior Research Biologist a professor at the local university cleared his throat and responded ""No no! That's not it at all. We only need $150000. We can train a group of domesticated geese to fly in formations of equal length and then compare their relative fitness to wild geese. We can then publish the results in the Journal of Wildlife Management.  About then the hardworking field biologist stands up and begins walking for the door. ""Where are you going?"" the group asks. ""I'm leaving"" he replies ""I've heard enough. No one has to give me $100000 to  find out that the reason one side of the ""V"" is longer is simply  because there are more damn geese on that side!"""
1501,"A biologist had been working on a remote research project in the Amazon jungle. Upon his return to the States he came down with a terrible illness. After his health had deteriorated his wife took him to a doctor who specialized in strange jungle diseases. The doctor gave him a complete examination and a  series of tests. After receiving the results of the tests the doctor  called the wife into his office alone. He told the young biologist's  wife ""Your husband is suffering from a very severe disease combined with horrible stress. If you don't do the following your husband will surely die."" ""Each morning fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant and make sure he is in a good mood. For lunch make him a nutritious meal. For dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him. Don't burden him with chores and generally do anything he asks. Don't discuss your problems with him as it will only make  his stress worse. And most importantly make love with your husband several times a week and satisfy his every whim. "" If you can do this for the next 10 months or so I think your husband will regain his health completely. Otherwise.......well... He'll probably die"" On the way home the husband asked his wife. ""What did the doctor say?""  she replied. ""Honey.....he says you're probably going to die."""
1502,"An old mountain man in Arkansas was sick and bedridden. He had not been outdoors for a few weeks and had a sharp craving for a meal of wild squirrel. He summoned his half-idiot son into the room and instructed him to go squirrel hunting and bring him back a squirrel or two. He also told his son to be very careful not to shoot the squirrel in the head as he would need its brains later to ""tan"" the squirrel's pelt. (Tanning a skin using the animal's brains is a common practice in certain areas it generally takes about one brain to tan one skin). The idiot son spent most of the day searching the woods for tree squirrels but was not having any luck. Finally high up in a sweet-gum tree he spotted a squirrel's head sticking out from a hole. He remembered his Pa's admonitions to save the brains. After deciding he may not have  another chance he shot it in the head thus ruining the brains.  r His sick Pa was upset ""I can't tan that skin without no brains!"" he said ""Now what am I a gonna do?"" Thinking quickly he remembered that up on the river there were 3 fisheries biologists doing some field work. ""Well we're only tanning one squirrel skin walk up the river and shoot one of them dang fish biologists and I'll use his brains to tan the skin"" he told the son. The son did as he was told and soon returned with the prize. As it turned out the brain wasn't large enough and the boy was upset as he would have to make another trip to harvest the other two biologist's brains. ""Look on the bright side boy"" the old man told him ""Two more  ought to be just enough. We'd have been in real trouble if they was  BOTANISTS!"""

In a dark corner he spotted a bird cage and in the cage was a parrot.  He asked the parrot: ""Was that you who said Jesus is watching me?""  ""Yes"" said the parrot.  The burglar breathed a sigh of relief and asked the parrot: ""What's your name?""  ""Clarence"" said the bird.  ""That's a dumb name for a parrot"" sneered the burglar.

'Well it has a cute little claw on the outside of every paw and another little claw on the inside of every paw - but the poor little thing has no claws at all in the middle of its paws!'  Her mother smiled. 'Don't worry Kitty. When you wake up on Christmas morning you'll find the claws are there.'  Now Kitty loved her kitten dearly but she worrie d about the claws in the middle of its paws. The days passed and there wasn't even a hint a clue or an inkling of claws in the middle of its paws.

There's only a few hours to go and there's not a hint or clue or an inkling as to claws as far as I can see.'  'Wait till you wake up on Christmas morning' her mother smiled and went on stuffing the turkey.  So Kitty went to sleep a worried girl. When she woke up on Christmas morning she ignored the presents in her stocking and rushed downstairs to look at her little kitten.  She was astounded amazed and just a little surprised to see that her  kitten had four claws on every paw! The middle ones had appeared as if  by magic.  Kitty rushed to her parent's bedroom.

Core drilling samples of earth were taken to a depth of 50m and during the core examinations small pieces of copper were discovered. After running many arduous tests on these samples the German government announced that the ancient Germans 25000 years ago had a nationwide telephone  network.

Her soul arrived up in heaven where she was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself. ""Welcome to Heaven"" said St.Peter. ""Before you get settled in though it seems we have a problem.

And with that St. Peter put the executive in an elevator and it went down-down-down to hell. The d oors opened and she found herself stepping out onto the putting green of a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club and standing in front of her were all her friends - fellow executives that she had worked with and they were all dressed in evening gowns and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks and they talked about old times. They played an excellent round of golf and at night went to the country club where she enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil who was actually a really nice guy (kinda cute) and she had a great time telling jokes and dancing. She was having such a good time that before she knew it it was time to leave. Everybody shook her hand and waved good- bye as she got on the elevator.  The elevator went up-up-up and opened back up at the Pearly Gates and found St. Peter waiting for her. ""Now it's time to spend a day in heaven"" he said.   So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. She had a great time and before she knew it her 24 hours were up and St. Peter came and got her.  ""So you've spent a day in hell and you've spent a day in heaven.

When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and Filth. She saw her friends were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks. The Devil came up to her and put his arm around her. ""I don't understand"" stammered the woman ""yesterday I was here and there was  a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and we danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.""  The Devil looked at her and smiled. ""Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're staff."""

If the gnu's ears were forward that meant a successful joyous year was almost certain to happen.

She was late in coming to check on the gnu. Well she saw the wrong ear position and predicted a bad year when in fact it was quite good.

""Throw them to the lions"" said the head keeper ""the lions will eat anything"". So the young keeper returned to the aquarium picked up all the dead fish and threw them into the lion's cage. That done he returned and asked what he should do now. He was instructed to go and clean out the ape house. Off he went and started cleaning.

9972,"An enterprising mayor of the city of Granby Quebec a community south of Montreal established a municipal zoo  that has become a significant tourist attraction. It has also given rise  to many unusual events. Last September one of the star attractions Arnold an Indonesian ape escaped to the dismay of the zoo director. The matter was a serious one because the members of the staff of the zoo while expert at caring for animals had no experience whatsoever in rounding them up or capturing them.  The zoo director appealed to the office of the mayor for help and the  secretary to the mayor asked ""Have you looked in the yellow pages""? The director said he hadn't but would immediately.  To his surprise under ""animal capturing service"" he found a listing for the Acme Ape Apprehenders. He called them immediately.  Within 20 minutes a panel truck arrived at the admin office of the zoo and  a small man emerged and rushed to the director who was waiting at  the door.  ""Is there a wooded area in the vicinity?"" the little man asked. The director said there was within one half mile from the zoo. ""Hop in the truck"" the little man said. The director did and they drove off.  Minutes later they arrived at a small grove and immediately spotted Arnold on a branch about 25 feet above the ground.  The two men got out went to the back of the truck and the little man opened the door. An excited little dog jumped out and began running around in circles.  The little man reached into the truck and took out a suitcase which he opened. In the suitcase were a pair of handcuffs which he handed to the zoo director a sawed off shotgun which he leaned against the trunk of the tree and a baseball bat.  ""Now"" the little man said ""I'm going up into the tree with the baseball bat and I'm going to knoc k the ape out of the tree. The instant the ape hits the ground the dog well trained will bite the ape by the crotch and chomp-down with his jaws. The ape will instantly and instinctively grab at his crotch with both hands due to the pain and you snap the handcuffs on and we've got him.  The zoo director pointing to the shotgun leaning against the tree said ""I'm not too sure about this -- what's the gun for?""  The little man said ""Look I'm an expert. I know what I'm doing and things will go just fine after all I have the baseball bat. I know my job and it'll never happen but if the ape should by any chance knock ME out of the tree SHOOT THE DOG!!!"""
